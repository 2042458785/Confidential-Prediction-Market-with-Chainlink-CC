A private, automated prediction market built with Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE). Users place encrypted bets on real-world events (e.g., weather, sports, finance). A Go‑based CRE workflow listens for on‑chain requests, fetches external data from APIs, determines the outcome, cryptographically signs the result, and submits it back to the blockchain – all without manual intervention.

🏆 Built for the Chainlink Hackathon

✨ Key Features

🔐 Privacy by Design – Bets are encrypted on‑chain using a temporary AES key; actual choices stay hidden until market resolution.
🤖 Fully Automated Settlement – Chainlink CRE workflow triggered by SettlementRequested event, executes external API calls, signs results, and writes to chain.
🔗 Multi‑Capability Orchestration – Integrates CRE’s Log Trigger, HTTP Capability, Sign Capability, and EVM Write Capability in a single Go workflow.
📊 Real‑World Data – Fetches temperature from public weather APIs (Open‑Meteo) – easily replaceable with any REST API.
⚡ Scalable & Extensible – Designed to support multiple outcome options, ZK‑proof decryption (future), and cross‑chain with CCIP.

🧠 Why This Matters

Existing prediction markets like Polymarket suffer from:

Public bets → front‑running, copycat strategies.
Manual settlement → slow, prone to manipulation.
Opaque outcomes → low user trust.
Our solution eliminates these issues by:

Encrypting bets to protect user strategy.
Automating settlement via Chainlink CRE – fast, tamper‑proof, verifiable.
Trusting cryptographic signatures from a decentralized oracle network instead of human judgment.

🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites

Node.js v18+ & npm
Go v1.21+
Hardhat
CRE CLI (for simulation/deployment)
Sepolia testnet ETH & LINK (from faucets.chain.link)

1. Clone & Install
   git clone https://github.com/2042458785/Confidential-Prediction-Market-with-Chainlink-CC
   cd confidential-prediction-market
   npm install
   go mod download
   2. Set Environment Variables
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...          # will be set after deployment
   CHAIN_SELECTOR=16015286601757825753  # Sepolia
   WEATHER_API_URL=https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast
3.  Deploy Smart Contract
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
4. Run the CRE Workflow (Simulation)
   cd workflow
   cre workflow simulate --file main.go --config config.json
5. Example config.json:
   {
   "contractAddress": "0x...",
   "chainSelector": 16015286601757825753,
   "apiConfig": {
   "url": "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast",
   "method": "GET",
   "headers": {}
   },
   "gasLimit": 500000
   }
6. (Optional) Deploy CRE Workflow
   cre workflow deploy --file main.go --name "prediction-market-settlement" --config config.json
   7. 📝 How to Use
      Create a Market (Admin)
      Call createMarket(description, closeTime, resolveWindow) on the contract.
      Example: "2025-03-10:London" – date and city name separated by colon.
      Place Encrypted Bets (Users)
      Use a temporary AES key to encrypt {option, amount}. Call placeBet(marketId, encryptedBet) with the encrypted blob and send the bet amount in ETH.
      Request Settlement (Anyone after deadline)
      Call requestSettlement(marketId). This emits the event that triggers the CRE workflow.
      CRE Workflow in Action

       Log Trigger captures the event.
   HTTP Capability geocodes the city and fetches current temperature.
   Outcome determined (temperature >5°C → 1, else 0).
   Sign Capability signs the outcome.
   EVM Write Capability submits submitResult(marketId, outcome, signature).
   Claim Winnings (Winners)
   Winners call claimWinnings(marketId, betIndex). Contract verifies their bet matched the outcome and sends proportional reward.
8. 🧪 Testing
   Run Solidity tests:
   npx hardhat test
   Run Go workflow simulation (as shown above).

🔮 Future Roadmap

Zero‑Knowledge Decryption – Replace admin‑reveal with user‑submitted ZK proofs using DECO, eliminating trusted parties.
Multi‑Outcome Markets – Support for more than binary outcomes (e.g., exact score, price range).
Cross‑Chain Liquidity – Use CCIP to allow betting from multiple chains and unify settlement.
AI‑Powered Events – Integrate with Gemini or other LLMs for complex event resolution (e.g., "Did Team A play better?").

### Component Details

**App.vue** - Main application container that manages wallet connection (MetaMask), view routing between market list and detail views, and market data loading from the smart contract.

**MarketList.vue** - Displays all available markets in a grid layout with refresh functionality. Includes embedded admin tools (DecodeTools, AdminRevealBets, AdminSubmitResult) for market management.

**MarketCard.vue** - Individual market card showing market ID, status badge (Open/Closed/Resolving/Resolved), description, total pool, bet count, and close time. Clickable to view details.

**MarketDetail.vue** - Comprehensive market view with betting interface (option selection, amount input), settlement request button for closed markets, and integrated ClaimWinnings component for resolved markets.

**ClaimWinnings.vue** - Displays user's bets for a resolved market with win/loss status, estimated rewards, and claim buttons. Automatically loads user bets and handles the claimWinnings transaction.

**DecodeTools.vue** - Developer utility to manually decode encrypted bet data (encryptedBet bytes) into readable option and amount values using ABI decoding.

**AdminRevealBets.vue** - Admin interface to load all bets for a market, decode them locally, and batch submit revealed data to the contract via revealBets() function. Required before users can claim winnings.

**AdminSubmitResult.vue** - Admin panel with two functions: (1) Set trusted signer address for result submission authorization, (2) Manually submit market results with signature verification. Includes auto-discovery of markets in "Resolving" state.

**TestSubmitResult.vue** - Testing interface for submitResult functionality. Shows current configuration (contract address, trusted signer, wallet match status), allows manual result submission with signature generation, and displays detailed signing process steps.

## Usage Instructions

1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner to connect MetaMask
2. Browse the market list to view all available prediction markets
3. Click on a market card to enter the detail page
4. Select betting option (Yes/No)
5. Enter bet amount
6. Click "Confirm Bet" to submit the transaction

## Notes

- Ensure MetaMask browser extension is installed
- Ensure your wallet is connected to the correct network (Sepolia testnet)
- Ensure your wallet has sufficient ETH for betting and gas fees
- The current version's encrypted betting data is a simplified implementation; for production environments, real encryption logic should be implemented
